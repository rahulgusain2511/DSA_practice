# Python Data Structures and Algorithms Practice



## Description

This repository contains Python code implementations of various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) for practice purposes. The primary goal is to provide a resource for developers and programming enthusiasts to sharpen their problem-solving skills and become proficient in DSA concepts using Python.

## Introduction

Data Structures and Algorithms are fundamental building blocks for writing efficient and robust code. They form the backbone of computer science and play a crucial role in solving complex problems. This repository aims to provide a collection of Python implementations of various data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and more. It also includes algorithms such as searching, sorting, graph traversal, dynamic programming, and more.

## Data Structures

The implemented data structures include:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Graphs
- Hash Tables
- Heaps
- and more...


## Algorithms

The implemented algorithms include:

- Searching (Linear Search, Binary Search, etc.)
- Sorting (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
- Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's Algorithm, etc.)
- Dynamic Programming (Fibonacci, Knapsack, etc.)
- Greedy Algorithms
- and more...

Just like the data structures, each algorithm is implemented in Python.
